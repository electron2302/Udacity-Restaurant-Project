### Conversation with Mentor

#### Me:
hey, what do i have to do in regards to my taporder or weher do i have to set tapindex ?
I dont get it.
my project review sad "Use tabindex to add focus to the elements explicitly"
i dont understand what i have to do. I cann tap thour my page no problem. What did i miss
my code is in https://github.com/electron2302/Udacity-Restaurant-Project

#### Mentor:
it seems that reviewer is insisting that you show can use tabindex to control tab order
but in my opinion unless the is an issue with how focus is managed that may not be necessary
i will as the mentor community

Simon, I was advised that Tab index does not need to be used in every component on the page for Stage 1. As long as the tab order flows naturally on the page, most components should retain the default tab index.
this advice came from the MSND mentor community

#### Me:
Big thank you for asking the "mentor community" on this question
then i will resubmit it with the other things changed, but i will not tup tap index somewere just to show, that i know how to use it, right ?

#### Mentor:
yes, please leave a note for the reviewer
you may include the information i shared with you
